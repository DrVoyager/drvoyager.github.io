			We have also published our work "Detecting Black-box Model Probing Attacks Through Probability Scores" with Open Access [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029295">pdf</a>].
			In a black-box model probing attack, the attacker sends a series of requests to a victim model to map out its classification boundary. 
			This attack is considered critical because it helps the attacker gain a better understanding of the model and launch follow-up attacks. 
			In our paper, we discovered that the sequences of top-2 probability scores generated by different model probing attacks form distinct patterns 
			that can be detected through time-series classification methods, such as Transformer and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM). 
			Our experiments showed that both Transformer and BiLSTM can detect known and unknown black-box model probing attacks and their variants, 
			where Transformer outperformed BiLSTM in detecting sophisticated adversarial strategies, such as diluted adversarial attacks. 
			Compared with existing defense methods, our classifiers can reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of adaptive probing attacks from 93% to 1.78%. 
			To facilitate further studies on black-box model probing attacks, we collected the probability score sequences generated by different black-box model probing attacks 
			and released them as an open dataset.
